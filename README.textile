Free Agents cannot temporarily belong to a team, such that the points they make do not contriubte towards the overall teams.

This is related to team OPP. A teams OPP should be calculated as total point made by team members and free agents playing that game / total shots by team members and free agents shots on a per game basis.

Changing attributes for a shot does not correctly update player objects
